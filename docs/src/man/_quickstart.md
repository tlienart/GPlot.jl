# Quickstart

Once both GLE and GPlot are successfully installed, this short tutorial should give a feeling for how things work; for more detailed instructions refer to the rest of the manual.
We will draw a simple plot with two curves, labels, and basic axis styling.

Let's start by creating a simple figure

```julia
fig = Figure()
```

!!! note

    it is not required to explicitly call `Figure()`; if no figure currently exists, the first plotting command will generate one with default parameters.

Let's now define a function which we would like to plot over the range `[-2.5, 2.5]`:

@@CODE:qs_ex1

where we've used the `@.` syntax to indicate that the operations are done pointwise on `x`. The syntax should hopefully feel reasonable thus far.

Let's add another curve on this figure and change the colour; let's also specify axis limits, where the ticks have to be etc:

@@CODE:qs_ex2

One thing worth noting at this point is that we follow the julia Plots convention adding a `!` after `plot` to indicate that it should modify the current graph without overwriting it (i.e. the curve is added on top of the existing one).

Now we can save this figure:

```julia
savefig(fig, "my_first_figure.pdf")
```

the command picks up the format (here `.pdf`) saves the file in the current folder.

    If you got this far thinking that all this seems reasonable, have a look at the rest of the doc to learn how to plot what you want and how you want it ðŸ“Š , happy plotting!
