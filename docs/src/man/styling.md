## Fonts

### Non-LaTeX mode

A bunch of fonts can be chosen from in non-LaTex mode but not all will do what you want.
The most notable points are:

* only a few are supported with SVG output,
* most have only basic unicode support (e.g. Greek letters) but will fail for more "advanced" symbols like ∫ or ∞.

They're good for basic use but as soon as you want symbols and a bit more flexibility, you're probably better off with the LaTeX mode.

**Reasonable fonts**

| rmi   | roman-italic |       |   ✘   |

| texmi |         |            |   ✔   |
