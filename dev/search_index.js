    "text": "GPlot is a plotting package wrapping the Graphics Layout Engine (and possibly GnuPlot or Asymptote in the future). The focus is on speed, ease of use and high-quality output.Key features:loading time and time to first plot much faster than Plots.jl (a couple of seconds),\nhandles LaTeX seamlessly,\nhandles transparency,\nimperative syntax similar to Matplotlib, Plots.jl, etc.,\nmultiple output formats: PNG, PDF, SVG, JPG, EPS or PS.What it\'s not meant for:interactivity (panning, zooming, ...)Note: the package is still being actively developed, feature requests, feedback or contributions are welcome."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "I discovered GLE a while back and liked the library though not the syntax and thought a wrapper for GLE in Julia with a matplotlib-like syntax was an interesting project to work on to learn more about graphics and Julia. A few hundreds of commits later and GPlot.jl is there and may be of interests or even useful to others.Of course the package is not as mature or feature complete as the current main plotting packages such as Plots.jl, Makie.jl, PyPlot.jl, Gadfly.jl, PGFPlots.jl, PGFPlotsX.jl, etc which you may prefer if you would rather avoid an experimental library."

    "text": "Basically GPlot translates plotting commands such as plot(1:5, randn(5)) intoauxiliary files containing the relevant data,\na GLE script corresponding to how the data must be drawn.This is then fed into the GLE engine which produces the desired output. If LaTeX is used, then the GLE engine uses pdflatex in the background (this incurs an overhead).The diagram below illustrates the workflow:                +----------------------+\n          +---> | Generated GLE code   +---+\nJulia     |     +----------------------+   +---> GLE engine\ncode   ---+                                |         +\n          |     +----------------------+   |         |\n          +---> | Auxiliary data files +---+         |\n                +----------------------+         (pdflatex)\n                                                     |\n                                                     |\n                                                     v\n                                              Output (PDF/PNG/...)"

We will draw a simple plot with two curves, labels, and basic axis styling.Let\'s start by creating a simple figure:fig = Figure()note: Note\nIt is not required to explicitly call Figure(); if no figure currently exists, the first plotting command will generate one with default parameters.Let\'s now define a function over the range [-2.5, 2.5] and plot it:x = range(-2.5, stop=2.5, length=100)\ny = @. exp(-x^2) * sin(x)\nplot(x, y, label=\"plot 1\")\nlegend()where we\'ve used the @. syntax to indicate that the operations are done pointwise on x (broadcasting). The syntax should hopefully feel reasonable thus far.(Image: )Let\'s add another curve on this figure and change the colour; let\'s also specify axis limits, where the ticks have to be etc:y2 = @. sin(x^2) * exp(-x/10)\nplot!(x, y2, col=\"blue\", lwidth=0.05, label=\"plot 2\")\n\nxlabel(\"x-axis\")\nylabel(\"y-axis\")\nxticks([-pi/2, 0, pi/2], [\"Ï€/2\", \"0\", \"Ï€/2\"])\nylim(-1.5, 1.5)\nyticks(-1:0.25:1)\n\nlegend()One thing worth noting at this point is that we follow Plots.jl\'s convention adding a ! after plot to indicate that it should modify the current graph without overwriting it (i.e. the new curve is added on top of the existing one).(Image: )Now we can save this figure:savefig(fig, \"my_first_figure.pdf\")the command picks up the format (here .pdf) saves the file in the current folder.comment: Comment\nIf you got this far thinking that all this seems reasonable, have a look at the rest of the doc to learn how to plot what you want and how you want it ðŸ“Š , happy plotting!"
