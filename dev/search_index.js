    "text": "GPlot is a plotting package wrapping the Graphics Layout Engine (and possibly GnuPlot and/or Asymptote in the future). The focus is on speed, ease of use and high-quality output.Key features:loading time and time-to-first-plot much faster than Plots.jl (a couple of seconds),\nhandles LaTeX seamlessly,\nhandles transparency,\nimperative syntax similar to Matplotlib, Plots.jl, etc.,\nmultiple output formats: PNG, PDF, SVG, JPG, EPS or PS.What it\'s not meant for:interactivity (panning, zooming, ...)Note: the package is still being actively developed, feature requests, feedback or contributions are welcome."

    "text": "I discovered the Graphics Layout Engine (GLE) a while back and liked what it could do though not the syntax and thought a wrapper for GLE in Julia with a matplotlib-like syntax was an interesting project to work on to learn more about graphics and Julia.The package is not as mature or feature complete as the current main plotting packages such as Plots.jl, Makie.jl, PyPlot.jl, Gadfly.jl, PGFPlots.jl, PGFPlotsX.jl, etc. which you may prefer if you would rather avoid an experimental library."

If LaTeX is used, the GLE engine also uses pdflatex in the background to produce the output (this incurs an overhead).The diagram below illustrates the workflow:                +----------------------+\n          +---> | Generated GLE code   +---+\nJulia     |     +----------------------+   +---> GLE engine\ncode   ---+                                |         +\n          |     +----------------------+   |         |\n          +---> | Auxiliary data files +---+         |\n                +----------------------+         (pdflatex)\n                                                     |\n                                                     |\n                                                     v\n                                              Output (PDF/PNG/...)"

The syntax should hopefully feel reasonable thus far and the output is illustrated below:(Image: )Let\'s add another curve on this figure and change the colour; let\'s also specify axis limits, where the ticks have to be etc:y2 = @. sin(x^2) * exp(-x/10)\nplot!(x, y2, col=\"blue\", lwidth=0.05, label=\"plot 2\")\n\nxlabel(\"x-axis\")\nylabel(\"y-axis\")\nxticks([-pi/2, 0, pi/2], [\"Ï€/2\", \"0\", \"Ï€/2\"])\nylim(-1.5, 1.5)\nyticks(-1:0.25:1)\n\nlegend()One thing worth noting at this point is that we follow Plots.jl\'s convention adding a ! after plot to indicate that it should modify the current graph without overwriting it (i.e. the new curve is added on top of the existing one).(Image: )Now we can save this figure:savefig(fig, \"my_first_figure.pdf\")the command picks up the format (here .pdf) and saves the file in the current folder.comment: Comment\nIf you got this far thinking that all this seems reasonable, have a look at the rest of the doc to learn how to plot what you want and how you want it ðŸ“Š , happy plotting!"
