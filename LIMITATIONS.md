# Limitations

## GLE

* somewhat limited number of markers
* markers are meant to be of the same colour than the line they're on, this can be bypassed by overlaying two lines (*done*) but this cannot easily be done with the legend entry.
* pdflatex, lualatex and xetex not supported, this has to do with how shapes are measured. ([see discussion](https://sourceforge.net/p/glx/mailman/glx-general/thread/79324F49-203C-4DD6-81A6-23128096B9F7@tudelft.nl/))
