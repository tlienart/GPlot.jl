# GPlot

**Note**: I'm not actively working on this at the moment but the project is working; I've been unfortunately too busy with other projects including [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl). I would very much like to get back to this though as I love GLE but no guarantees as to when that would happen...

GPlot is a plotting package wrapping the [Graphics Layout Engine](http://glx.sourceforge.net/index.html) (and possibly GnuPlot in the future).
The focus is on speed, ease of use and high-quality output.

Have a look at [the docs](https://tlienart.github.io/GPlot.jl/dev) if you wish to try this package out.

**Note**: this package is very much WIP. If you would like to help, I'll be happy to hear from you.
Simply using the package and report issues or request features here would be very useful.
