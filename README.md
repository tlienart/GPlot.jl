GPlot is a plotting package wrapping the [Graphics Layout Engine](http://glx.sourceforge.net/index.html) (and possibly GnuPlot in the future).
The focus is on speed, ease of use and high-quality output.

Have a look at [the docs](https://tlienart.github.io/GPlot.jl/dev) if you wish to try this package out.

**Note**: this package is very much WIP. If you would like to help, I'll be happy to hear from you. One of the most helpful would simply be to use the code and report issues or request features here.
